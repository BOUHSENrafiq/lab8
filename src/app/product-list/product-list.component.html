<h2>Products</h2>

<!--    display a list of product names from products.ts.
        To iterate over the predefined list of products, put the *ngFor directive on a <div>
        With *ngFor, the <div> repeats for each product in the list.
        Directives with an asterisk are structural directives.
-->
<div *ngFor="let product of products; index as productId">

    <!--    To display the names of the products, use the interpolation syntax {{ }}.
            Interpolation renders a property's value as text.
            Inside the <div>, add an <h3> to display the interpolation of the product's name property:
             Syntax: <h3>{{ product.name }}</h3>
    -->
    <h3>
        <!-- Make each product name a link to product details
             Add the <a> element and set its title to be the product's name by using the property binding [ ]
             The RouterLink directive gives the router control over the anchor element
        -->
        <a [title]="product.name + ' :for details press link'" [routerLink]="['/products', productId]">
            {{ product.name }}
        </a>
    </h3>
        <!--    Add the product descriptions.
                On the <p> element, use an *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element if the current product has a description.
        -->
    <p *ngIf="product.description">
        Description: {{ product.description }}
    </p>
